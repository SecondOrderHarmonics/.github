#### Supportig us / Gaining early access
Open Hardware Projects, and related F/OSS (Free/Open Source Software), can be a lot of work. We do not have active sponsorship, Kickstarter Campaigns or anything similar. We currently live off other Day Jobs and custom design inquiries/modding of existing audio HW (from outboard gear to retooling and/or modding entire recording consoles, Working as Stand-by engineer(s) during Recording/Tracking and Mixing sessions as well as renting out our own high-end outboard gear for recording and mixing sessions). That being said: We're happy to share some of our work. Most of it, actually. And will try to keep to our understanding that welll-tested field deployed or commmercially available units will be made fully open later on in very specific cases (seee 'Licensing' below). You can support/help us and/or gain early access to projects, contribute ideas via Patreon [^3]

### So what's open source / hardware and what isn't?
__Everything  is__ as per our principles. Due to R&D, Testing and production costs of bigger HW projects or custom designs for private customers (which are encouraged to agree to open-source our work in time) - we reserve the right to have some more advanced products only available with a delay. There's multiple reasons for this:

1. Real world testing and feedback from customers, which takes some time depending on complexity of the product and adoption.
2. Time and Material cost on our own work (non-contract) that exceeds multiple thousands of Euros / USD.
3. As is already the case: we find hardware or software bugs in time and do not open-source, but reserve the time to fix any isssues that may cause 3rd parties to produce faulty products.
4. Missing documentation: if we open-source an advanced product we want to make sure you know how to re-produce every step 1:1 if you want to. Tests are available (LTSpice, Unit Tests, CI/CD Bots etc.), and lastly:
5. Security issues that come to our attention either by finding them ourselves or being reported. We fix them, then open a repo again to the public so you don't end up with costs for PCBA, SMT etc. cost just to have an insecure PCB laying around and having to re-order everything.

#### Supportig us / Gaining early access
Open HArdware Projects, and related FOSS are a lot of work. We're happy to share some of it. Most of it, actually. And will try to keep to our understanding that welll-tested field deployed or commmercially available units will be made fully open later on in very specific cases (seee 'Licensing' below). You can support/help us and/or gain early access to projects, contribute ideas via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/cw/secondorderharmonics


## Licensing
Be aware that Projects may have varying kinds of more or less premissive Open Hardware / Software Licenses attached - usually depending on the project, a related customer or heavy upfromt-R&D involved with a specific project.
